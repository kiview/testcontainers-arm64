= Test Java Application on Arm64 inside an Amd64 node on Github Actions

This is a simple Quarkus Application containing a REST client that communicates with a remote Hello service.

During integration tests, the Hello service is served by a container (`https://hub.docker.com/r/thomaspoignant/hello-world-rest-json[thomaspoignant/hello-world-rest-json]`) started via Testcontainers.

To test the whole, the following need to get done:

* Install QEMU static binaries using `setup-qemu-action`
* Start Maven build inside an Arm64 Container
* Configure the above container to be able to communicate with the Docker Daemon to
  * Spawn new containers (a.k.a. https://java.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/continuous_integration/dind_patterns[Docker wormhole pattern])
  * Disable Ryuk due to https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/8138[testcontainers#8138]
